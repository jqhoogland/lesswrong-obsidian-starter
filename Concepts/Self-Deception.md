# Self-Deception
Self-deception is a state of preserving a wrong [belief](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/belief), often facilitated by denying or [rationalizing away](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/rationalization) the relevance, significance, or importance of opposing [evidence](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/evidence) and logical arguments. Beliefs supported by self-deception are often chosen for reasons other than how closely those beliefs approximate [truth](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/truth-semantics-and-meaning).

*Related:* [Anticipated Experiences](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/anticipated-experiences?showPostCount=true&useTagName=true), [Motivated Reasoning](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/motivated-reasoning?showPostCount=true&useTagName=true), [Rationalization](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalization?showPostCount=true&useTagName=true)

On LessWrong, a common distinction is between [beliefs as expectation-controllers](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/anticipated-experiences?showPostCount=false&useTagName=false) and [other](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dLbkrPu5STNCBLRjr/applause-lights) [things](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NMoLJuDJEms7Ku9XS/guessing-the-teacher-s-password) [people](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7gRSERQZbqTuLX5re/p/CqyJzDZWvGhhFJ7dY) [commonly](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7gRSERQZbqTuLX5re/p/RmCjazjupRGcHSm5N) [label](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7gRSERQZbqTuLX5re/p/nYkMLFpx77Rz3uo9c) as beliefs. When these different things conflict, a person is said to have engaged in self-deception.

Deceiving yourself is [harder than it seems](https://lessestwrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/). What looks like a successively adopted false belief may actually be just a [belief in false belief](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/belief-in-belief).
