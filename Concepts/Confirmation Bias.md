# Confirmation Bias
Confirmation bias (also known as positive bias) is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or strengthens one's prior personal beliefs or hypotheses [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)]. Â For example, one might test hypotheses with positive rather than negative examples, thus missing obvious disconfirming tests.
