A technical explanation is an explanation of a phenomenon that makes you [anticipate certain experiences](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/making-beliefs-pay-rent). A proper technical explanation controls anticipation strictly, weighting your [priors](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/priors) and [evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/evidence) precisely to create the justified amount of uncertainty.

Technical explanations are contrasted with verbal explanations, which give the impression of understanding without actually producing the proper expectation.
