# Instrumental Convergence
Instrumental convergence or convergent instrumental values is the theorized tendency for most sufficiently intelligent agents to pursue potentially unbounded instrumental goals such as self-preservation and resource acquisition [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence)]. This concept has also been discussed under the term *basic drives.*

The idea was first explored by [Steve Omohundro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Omohundro). He argued that sufficiently advanced AI systems would all naturally discover similar instrumental subgoals. The view that there are important basic AI drives was subsequently defended by [Nick Bostrom](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/nick-bostrom) as the* instrumental convergence thesis*, or the *convergent instrumental goals thesis*. On this view, a few goals are [instrumental](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/instrumental-value) to almost all possible [final](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/terminal-value) goals. Therefore, all advanced AIs will pursue these instrumental goals. Omohundro uses microeconomic theory by von Neumann to support this idea.

## Omohundroâ€™s Drives
Omohundro presents two sets of values, one for self-improving artificial intelligences [1](http://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/nature_of_self_improving_ai.pdf) and another he says will emerge in any sufficiently advanced AGI system [2](http://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf). The former set is composed of four main drives:...[(Read More)]()
