# Mind Projection Fallacy
The Mind Projection Fallacy is the error of projecting the properties of your own mind onto the external world.

In particular, the concept was applied in the critique of [frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) interpretation of the notion of [probability](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/probability) as a property of physical systems rather than an epistemic device concerned with levels of certainty, [Bayesian probability](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/bayesian-probability)....[(Read More)]()
