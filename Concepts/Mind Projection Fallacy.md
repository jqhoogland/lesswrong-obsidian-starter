# Mind Projection Fallacy
The Mind Projection Fallacy is the error of projecting the properties of your own mind onto the external world. For example, one might erroneously think that because they enjoy the taste of chocolate, the chocolate has the inherent property of tastiness, and therefore everyone else must like its taste too.

Overcoming the mind project fallacy requires realizing that our minds are not transparent windows unto veridical reality; when you look at a rock, you experience not the the rock itself, but your mind's *representation* of the rock, reconstructed from photons bouncing off its surface. Sugar in and of itself is not *inherently* sweet; the sugar itself only has the chemical properties that it does, which your brain *interprets* as sweet.
