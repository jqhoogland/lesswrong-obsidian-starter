# Fixed Point Theorems
Fixed Point Theorems are very general theorems in mathematics that show for a given function f and input x that f(x)=x. We say that the input x is a fixed point for the function f.

These come up most commonly on LessWrong in work around [Embedded Agency](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/embedded-agency) research, as well as in discussion of game theory.
