The absurdity heuristic classifies highly untypical situations as "absurd", or [Antiprediction|impossible](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/antiprediction). While normally very useful as a form of [Epistemic Hygiene|epistemic hygiene](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/epistemic-hygiene), allowing us to detect nonsense, it suffers from the same problems as the [Representativeness Heuristic|representativeness heuristic](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/representativeness-heuristic).

There are a number of situations in which the absurdity heuristic is wrong. A deep theory has to [Shut Up and Multiply|override the intuitive expectation](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/shut-up-and-multiply). Where you don't expect intuition to construct an [Technical Explanation|adequate model](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/technical-explanation) of reality, classifying an idea as impossible may be [Overconfidence|overconfident](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/overconfidence). [The future is usually "absurd"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/j1/stranger_than_history/), although sometimes it's possible to [Exploratory Engineering|rigorously infer low bounds on capabilities of the future](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/exploratory-engineering), proving possible what is intuitively absurd.
