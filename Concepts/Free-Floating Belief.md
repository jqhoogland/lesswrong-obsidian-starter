A free-floating belief is a [belief](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/belief) that both [doesn't follow from observations](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/beliefs-require-observations) and doesn't restrict [which experiences to anticipate](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/making-beliefs-pay-rent). It is both unfounded and useless.
