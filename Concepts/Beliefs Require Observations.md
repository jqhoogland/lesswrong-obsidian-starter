To form accurate [beliefs](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/belief) about something, you really do have to observe it. This can be viewed as a special case of the second law of [thermodynamics](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/thermodynamics), in fact, since "knowledge" is correlation of belief with reality, which is mutual information, which is a form of negentropy.
