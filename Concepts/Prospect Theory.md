Prospect Theory is an attempt by [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky) and [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) to construct a [decision theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/decision-theory) that describes the actual behavior of humans, rather than idealized [rational](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationality) decision-making.

An agent, in prospect theory:

- is 
- [loss-averse](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/loss-aversion)
- , and so weighs losses (relative to some reference point) more strongly than gains
- is 
- [risk-averse](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/risk_aversion)
-  with respect to gains, but risk-seeking with respect to losses
- uses probability 
- weighting:
-  small probabilities count more and larger probabilities count less than they would under 
- [expected utility](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/expected-utility)
- .
