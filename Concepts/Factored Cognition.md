# Factored Cognition
Factored cognition is an approach to artificial intelligence where sophisticated learning and reasoning is broken down (or factored) into many small and mostly independent tasks [[1](https://ought.org/research/factored-cognition)].

Factored Cognition is related to [*Iterated Amplification* (IDA)](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/iterated-amplification).
