Possessing absolute certainty in a fact, or [Bayesian Probability|Bayesian probability](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/bayesian-probability) of 1, isn't a good idea. Losing an epistemic bet made with absolute certainty corresponds to receiving infinite negative payoff, according to the logarithmic [Scoring Rule|proper scoring rule](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/scoring-rule).

The same principle applies to mathematical truths. Not possessing absolute certainty in math doesn't make the math itself uncertain, the same way that an [The Map Is Not The Territory|uncertain map](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/the-map-is-not-the-territory) doesn't cause the territory to blur out. The world, and the math, are precise, while knowledge about them is incomplete.

The impossibility of justified absolute certainty is sometimes used as a [Rationalization|rationalization](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalization) for the [Fallacy of Gray|fallacy of gray](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/fallacy-of-gray).
