# Counterfactuals
Counterfactual reasoning is about looking at choices you *could* *have *made, but didn't.

Counterfactuals are similar to [Hypotheticals|hypotheticals](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/hypotheticals) (but tend to focus on choices you could have made, rather than situations you could have been in).Â
