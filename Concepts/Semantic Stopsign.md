A semantic stopsign or curiosity stopper is a meaningless, generic explanation that creates the illusion of giving an answer, without actually explaining anything. Semantic stopsigns destroy [Curiosity|curiosity](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/curiosity), giving surrogate answers and stopping the search for [Truth, Semantics, & Meaning|truth](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/truth-semantics-and-meaning) prematurely. Can preserve [Improper Belief|incorrect beliefs](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/improper-belief) for a long time, insisting on following [Cached Thoughts|cached thought](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/cached-thought) without rethinking anything. A tool of [Dark Arts|dark arts](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/dark-arts) and an important part of any [Anti-Epistemology|anti-epistemology](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/anti-epistemology).

When specific words act as stopsigns, placing a [Bad title|rationalist taboo](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalist-taboo) on them may help. [Epistemic Hygiene|Epistemic hygiene](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/epistemic-hygiene) allows excluding some of the stopsigns raised by [Arguments As Soldiers|partial arguers](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/arguments-as-soldiers) or by your own [cognitive biases](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/cognitive_biases).
