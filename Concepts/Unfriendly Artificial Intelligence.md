An Unfriendly artificial intelligence (or UFAI) is an [artificial general intelligence](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/artificial-general-intelligence) capable of causing [great harm](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/existential-risk) to humanity, and having goals that [make it useful](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Instrumental_values) for the AI to do so. The AI's goals don't need to be antagonistic to humanity's goals for it to be Unfriendly; there are [strong reasons](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/instrumental-convergence) to expect that almost any powerful AGI not explicitly programmed to be benevolent to humans is lethal. A [paperclip maximizer](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/paperclip-maximizer) is often imagined as an illustrative example of an unFriendly AI indifferent to humanity. An AGI specifically designed to have a positive effect on humanity is called a [Friendly AI](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Friendly_AI).
