Belief in belief is a situation where a model of the world you claim and believe to have is at odds with a model of the world that [explains](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/technical-explanation) your actions and drives your [anticipation of experience](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/making-beliefs-pay-rent). You are always ready to provide an excuse for the next experiment not supporting your stated belief, because you know the outcome of the experiment in advance, but have to [rationalize](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalization) it in terms of the stated belief. Belief in belief can be seen as a form of [compartmentalization](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/compartmentalization), which protects your actual model of the world from insane memes that survive as stated beliefs. Were you to [really believe](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/bite-the-bullet) and not just believe in belief, the consequences of error would be much more severe.
