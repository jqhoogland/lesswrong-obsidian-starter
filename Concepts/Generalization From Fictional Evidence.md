The logical fallacy of generalization from fictional evidence consists in drawing real-world conclusions based on statements invented and selected for the purpose of writing fiction.

It was first coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky in [a talk he gave in 2003](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/1097-predicting-the-future-eliezer-yudkowsky/), and later in his essay [The Logical Fallacy of Generalization from Fictional Evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rHBdcHGLJ7KvLJQPk/the-logical-fallacy-of-generalization-from-fictional).
