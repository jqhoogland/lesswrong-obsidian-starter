# Institution Design
Mechanism Design is the theory of how to design [incentives](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/incentives) for strategic agents, such that the agents acting according to their selfish interests will result in a desired outcome. It can be applied to things like institution design, [voting systems](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/voting-theory), school admissions, regulation of monopolists, market design, and auction design. Think of it as the engineering side of game theory, thinking backward from a desired goal, and designing structures that lead strategic agents to behave in a way that achieves that goal.
