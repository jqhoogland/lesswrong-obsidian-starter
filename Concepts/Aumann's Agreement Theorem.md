# Aumann's Agreement Theorem
Aumann's agreement theorem, roughly speaking, says that two agents acting rationally (in a certain precise sense) and with [common knowledge](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/common-knowledge) of each other's beliefs cannot agree to disagree. More specifically, if two people are genuine [Bayesians](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/bayesianism), share common [priors](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/priors), and have common knowledge of each other's current probability assignments, then they must have equal probability assignments.
