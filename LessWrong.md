— Piet Hein

Hence the name LessWrong. We might never attain perfect understanding of the world, but we can at least strive to become less and less wrong each day.

We are a community dedicated to improving our reasoning and decision-making. We seek to hold true beliefs and to be effective at accomplishing our goals. More generally, we work to develop and practice the art of human rationality.

**To that end, LessWrong is a place to 1) develop and train rationality, and 2) apply one’s rationality to real-world problems.**

LessWrong serves these purposes with its [library of rationality writings](https://www.lesswrong.com/library), [community discussion forum](https://www.lesswrong.com/allPosts), [open questions research platform](https://www.lesswrong.com/questions), and [community page for in-person events](https://www.lesswrong.com/community).
