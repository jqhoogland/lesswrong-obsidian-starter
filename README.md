# LessWrong Starter

> ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome. This vault is a digital accompaniment to the [[LessWrong]] wiki. It's a starting point for you to take notes on the LessWrong core curriculum and concepts (using a personal knowledge management system like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)).

### Motivation
LessWrong has accumulated a lot of posts over the years, which can be daunting for newcomers. Sure you can read through [[Rationality A-Z|The Sequences]], but it's going to take a lot more work to actually keep the information in long-term memory. Consider this a framework for your personal journey to rationality. 

In particular, the aim is:
- To guide you through the [[Core Reading]].
- And to get you up to speed with the [[Core Concepts]] and [[Jargon]].[^0]

[^0]: with the help of [[Anki]].

### Structure
- This vault consists of note-taking templates[^1] for each of the posts in the [[Core Reading]] & each of the [[Core Concepts]]. 
- Each article has already been linked to the relevant concepts it contains and vice-versa. 

	[^1]: We've already linked the templates to each other and added metadata like tags, authors, and links. For the rest, templates are most empty. There's room to create flashcards with [Obsidian_to_Anki](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki), and concept notes include a placeholder definition.

### How to use
The [[Reading Orders]] page lists a few different ways you might want to approach the curriculum.
- You can take the "traditional" route by beginning with [[Rationality A-Z|The Sequences]] and other "core readings" ([[HPMOR]], [[The Codex]]). As you go through you'll naturally stumble across most of the [[Core Concepts]].  
- You can follow one of [[Reading Orders#Alternative Orders|several alternative orders]] proposed by various LessWrong readers over the years.  
- You can start with the [[Core Concepts]] (following their order or what you find interesting) and use each concept as a starting point to read related articles.
- Or you can [[Steelmanning Divination|embrace randomness]] and use the random button (left sidebar) to work your way through the content at random. 

All of LessWrong's content depends on all the other content, so there isn't one correct way to go through everything. We recommend a balanced mix of the approaches. 

As you go make your way through the concepts, consider incorporating [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/about). Each concept note has room for you to fill in your own definition, so you can automatically create a deck of Concept flashcards. (This requires you to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the [Obsidian to Anki plugin](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki/wiki)).
